# arq

Arq is a library to simplify interactions with files backed up by
[Arqbackup](https://www.arqbackup.com/).

Currently it supports only files generated by Arq (the program) versions 4.5 and above.

In its present state, this library allows reading files but never writing, so it's not
possible to build a full replacement of Arq (the program) with this library.

NOTE: A lot of the documentation, especially the one describing the data formats,
comes from [https://arqbackup.com](https://www.arqbackup.com/arq_data_format.txt). All
credit should go to those folks.

### Installation

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
arq = "0.1"
```

### Examples

1. Reading a computer info entry:

```rust
extern crate arq;
let reader = std::io::Cursor::new("<plist version=\"1.0\">
   <dict>
       <key>userName</key>
       <string>someuser</string>
       <key>computerName</key>
       <string>somecomputer</string>
   </dict>
   </plist>");
let data = arq::computer::ComputerInfo::new(reader, "someuuid".to_string()).unwrap();
assert_eq!(data.computer_name, "somecomputer".to_string());
assert_eq!(data.user_name, "someuser".to_string());
assert_eq!(data.uuid, "someuuid".to_string());
```

2. Reading a tree

Note: Usually one reads this from a file, not used directly like shown here.

```rust
let tree_bytes = [0, 0, 2, 182, 159, 84, 114, 101, 101, 86, 48, 50, 50, 0, 1, 0, 30, 255, 11, 1, 245, 0, 0, 0, 20, 0, 0, 65, 237, 0, 0, 0, 0, 92, 197, 219, 103, 0, 0, 0, 0, 16, 90, 33, 177, 75, 0, 1, 132, 2, 77, 81, 191, 0, 0, 0, 4, 28, 0, 15, 48, 0, 3, 17, 16, 31, 0, 193, 92, 197, 219, 84, 0, 0, 0, 0, 48, 246, 52, 114, 17, 0, 67, 0, 0, 2, 1, 9, 0, 145, 8, 115, 111, 109, 101, 102, 105, 108, 101, 16, 0, 17, 2, 6, 0, 2, 2, 0, 20, 1, 35, 0, 244, 30, 40, 100, 97, 56, 97, 48, 48, 51, 53, 55, 54, 52, 51, 100, 52, 56, 49, 98, 53, 98, 52, 54, 99, 57, 100, 99, 57, 99, 52, 49, 50, 55, 55, 98, 51, 53, 98, 57, 101, 56, 53, 1, 0, 0, 0, 53, 0, 6, 2, 0, 22, 12, 11, 0, 15, 2, 0, 13, 4, 3, 1, 41, 129, 164, 3, 1, 60, 92, 158, 217, 58, 0, 5, 103, 0, 5, 9, 0, 146, 0, 1, 0, 0, 4, 2, 77, 81, 220, 11, 0, 2, 2, 0, 5, 22, 1, 3, 67, 0, 5, 16, 0, 50, 89, 212, 77, 34, 0, 85, 0, 8, 0, 0, 16, 182, 0, 177, 10, 116, 111, 112, 95, 102, 111, 108, 100, 101, 114, 89, 0, 15, 16, 1, 3, 255, 25, 99, 48, 53, 55, 49, 53, 51, 55, 100, 53, 55, 100, 57, 52, 56, 56, 49, 54, 52, 51, 48, 51, 57, 53, 48, 100, 102, 100, 101, 100, 53, 99, 98, 54, 99, 102, 99, 100, 50, 48, 16, 1, 3, 19, 39, 121, 0, 15, 2, 0, 116, 80, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0];
let tree = arq::tree::Tree::new(&tree_bytes, arq::compression::CompressionType::LZ4).unwrap();
assert_eq!(tree.version, 22);
```

library at [https://github.com/nlopes/evu](https://github.com/nlopes/evu).**
